Name
Challenge 3 - Random Password Generator

Description
This is a random password generator.  The point of this challenge was to figure out how to both define variables and declare functions.  Using those to gather information from the HTML to assemble a password with certain conditions.  It took me many tutorials before I finally understood it so I went ahead and decided to try the slider instead of the number box just for fun.  I think it looks much better, but then brought some other challenges.  It was a difficult project but it was very informational and I can't wait to see what I can do with this knowledge.

Roadmap
Would love to make the visuals more appealing with CSS, but didn't want to interfere with the project parameters.  After challenge has been graded I am definitely going to play around with it some more.
